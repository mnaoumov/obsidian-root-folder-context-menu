/**
 * The screenshot-capture suites (T461-P21) that write
 * `images/screenshots/screenshot-*.png`.
 *
 * There is no android capture suite here YET. The mobile hooks do attach as of
 * T506-P32 — the vault name at the top of the left drawer is the anchor — so a
 * mobile set is owed and is tracked in T461-P21. Named `*.desktop-capture.`
 * rather than
 * `*.desktop.` / `*.android.` so they match NONE of the standard project globs.
 * That keeps them out of `npm run test:integration` entirely — capturing is an
 * explicit operation (`npm run capture:screenshots`), not something every test
 * run does. Folding them into the standard projects would rewrite ten PNGs on
 * every run and dirty the tree mid-release.
