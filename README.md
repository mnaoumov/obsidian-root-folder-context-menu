# Root Folder Context Menu

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that enables context menu for vault root folder

By default, `Obsidian` doesn't show the context menu when you right-click on the vault title on the top of the `Files` pane.

This plugins removes this limitation, so all folder context actions such as `New note` can be invoked.

## Installation

- `Root Folder Context Menu` is available on [the official Community Plugins repository](https://obsidian.md/plugins) now.
- Beta releases can be installed through [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
